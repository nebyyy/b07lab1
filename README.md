- Polynomial.java contains the class polynomial which represents a polynomial by using an array of doubles. A polynomial is assumed to have the form 𝑎0 + 𝑎1𝑥1 + ⋯ + 𝑎𝑛−1𝑥𝑛−1.
For example, the polynomial 6 − 2𝑥 + 5𝑥3 would be represented using the array [6, -2, 0, 5]. This class has methods add, evaluate and hasRoot; the behaviours of these methods are demonstrated upon running driver.java.

- Driver.java contains the main method which constructs two polynomials and calls the aforementioned polynomial class to demonstrate the behaviours of its methods.
